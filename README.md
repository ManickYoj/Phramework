# Phramework

A component-based game-creation framework written in Python. Heavily influenced by the Unity game engine.

## Motivation

In the context of Olin College's game development club, I have seen many of my peers, knowledgeable in Python but lacking game architecturing experience, frustrated by having to learn how to use an engine using an unfamiliar language to start building a game at scale. Phramework serves as a "good-enough" basis to allow Python-versed students to build games without having to worry about architecture or learning new languages and interfaces.
